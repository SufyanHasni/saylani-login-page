# Saylani Login Page â€“ HTML & CSS Project

This project is a modern, responsive **login page** developed using **pure HTML and CSS**. It was created as part of an assignment from **SMIT (Saylani Mass IT Training)** under the guidance of **Sir Arham**. The design is inspired by the Saylani Welfare login portal, focusing on clean layout, accessibility, and user-friendly interaction.

The login page includes input fields for **CNIC** and **password**, styled buttons for user interaction, and a professional interface that mimics real-world login systems. It's a great demonstration of how to create functional UI components without relying on JavaScript or external libraries.

The layout is built using **Flexbox**, which ensures that the form remains centered and properly aligned across various screen sizes. Special attention has been given to spacing, padding, and typography to make the user experience smooth and visually appealing.
